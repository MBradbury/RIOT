@brief       Support for the nRF52840-Dongle

### General information

The nRF52840-Dongle is a bare USB-stick shaped device that houses barely
anything than the nRF52840 itself, which offers BLE and 802.15.4 and USB
connectivity.

Unlike similar sticks (like the @ref boards_nrf52840-mdk), it features no
dedicated programmer hardware but relies on direct USB communication with a
built-in bootloader.

The board features two LEDs (LD1: green, LD2: RGB), a user (SW1) and a
reset button as well as 15 configurable external pins.

### Flash the board

FlockLab manages flashing the board. It performs a full erase before writing the new image.
This means that the image provided to FlockLab contains a bootloader.
